<p class="write">The iPhone 11 Pro, like the prior-generation iPhone XS, has an IP68 water resistance rating, but it is more water resistant. It is rated to survive a depth of four meters (13 feet) for up to 30 minutes, which is an improvement over the two meter rating in the XS and the two meter rating in the current iPhone 11.

In the IP68 number, the 6 refers to dust resistance (and means the iPhone 11 Pro can hold up to dirt, dust, and other particulates), while the 8 pertains to water resistance. IP6x is the highest dust resistance rating that exists.</p>

<h1 class="mark"> <mark>Display</mark></h1>
<p class="note">The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max use a "Super Retina" XDR display, which Apple says is its best display ever in an iPhone. The Super Retina display features support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and wide color gamut for unparalleled color accuracy.

The Super Retina display features vivid, true-to-life colors, deeper blacks, and, new this year, a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, up from 1,000,000:1.<br>
Compared to a traditional LCD display, such as the display in the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro is noticeably higher quality, especially when it comes to highlights and shadows. Blacks are blacker, whites are whiter, and everything just looks more realistic and like it does in real life.</p>
